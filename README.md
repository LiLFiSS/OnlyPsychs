# OnlyPsychs
OnlyPsychs was a platform designed to assist users in search of therapists find one that best suites their mental health needs.
There are three types of users that can access this platform. These users are: administrator, therapist, main user (client)
Administrator - Responsible for managing all users on the platform.
Therapist - Can decide whether or not to accept a client, responsible for managing clients, can create client progresss notes for each client. 
Client - Before being taken as a client by a therapist, this user must first complete a short questionnaire to determine which group of therapists would be best suited for them (i.e. therapists that specialize in any particular mental health disorder field this user may be experiencing). Upon the completion of this questionnaire, they can select from the list of avaliable therapist. They are free to view each therapist's profile before making their selection. An appointment request must then be made by the user to the chosen therapist, which the therapist can decide to take this person on as a client or not. The client can also leave a review on their therapist which would be displayed on the reviews section on the therapist's profile.
